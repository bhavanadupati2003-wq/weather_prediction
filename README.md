# 🌦️ Weather Prediction App

A Machine Learning–based web application that predicts the **weather type** based on user-provided environmental conditions such as precipitation, temperature, and wind speed.  
Built using **Python** and deployed with **Streamlit** for an interactive experience.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Input weather parameters (precipitation, temperature, wind speed)
- Predicts weather types (e.g., Rain, Snow, Sun, Drizzle)
- Real-time predictions
- Clean and interactive user interface
- Beginner-friendly ML project

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. User enters weather-related input values  
2. Inputs are processed and passed to a trained ML model  
3. The model predicts the most likely weather condition  
4. The predicted weather type is displayed instantly
